- Configure Channels: This is the channel configuration tool.  From here you can modify the settings for each individual channel.

- Auto-off Timer: The amount of time (in minutes) of idle time before the script is automatically stopped.

- Force Channel Reset: If you want your channels to be reanalyzed then you
can turn this on.

- Time Between Channel Resets: This is how often your channels will be reset.
Generally, this is done automatically based on the duration of the individual
channels and how long they've been watched.  You can change this to reset every
certain time period (day, week, month).

- Default channel times at startup: This affects where the channels start
playing when the script starts.  Resume will pick everything up where it left
off.  Random will start each channel in a random spot.  Real-Time will act like
the script was never shut down, and will play things at the time the EPG said
they would play.

- Background Updating: The script uses multiple threads to keep channels up-
to-date while other channels are playing.  In general, this is fine.  If your
computer is too slow, though, it may cause stuttering in the video playback.
This setting allows you to minimize or disable the use of these background
threads.

- Enable Channel Sharing: Share the same configuration and channel list
between multiple computers.  If you're using real-time mode (the default) then
you can stop watching one show on one computer and pick it up on the other.  Or
you can have both computers playing the same lists at the same time.

- Shared Channels Folder: If channel sharing is enabled, this is the location
available from both computers that will keep the settings and channel infor-
mation.



- Info when Changing Channels: Pops up a small window on the bottom of the
screen where the current show information is displayed when changing channels.

- Always show channel logo: Always display the current channel logo.

- Channel Logo Folder: The place where channel logos are stored.

- Clock Display: Select between a 12-hour or 24-hour clock in the EPG.

- Show Coming Up Next box: A little box will notify you of what's coming up
next when the current show is nearly finished.

- Hide very short videos: Don't show clips shorter than 60 seconds in the
EPG, coming up next box, or info box.  This is helpful if you use bumpers or
commercials.
